This was a small look into some of the traffic data that is collecting by monitoring devices set up by the state of GA. 
This project was an extremely small scale project to showcase the skills and power of analytics into subjects outside 
of what people typically imagine when they thing of the word "analytics". 

This project was completed in collaboration with Sharon Nancy and Raheela Charania.

The data was collected using the Traffic Analysis and Data Application tool found on the Georgia Department of Transportation's website: https://www.dot.ga.gov/GDOT/Pages/RoadTrafficData.aspx
